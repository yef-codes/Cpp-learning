<h1>"Cpp-learning" Repository</h1>
<hr/>
<p> Contains coding exercises that I completed while learning C++ language.
Here you can find exercises from programming courses I took, books that I mastered on my own and various minor thematic developments.
My solutions may not be optimal, but each of them copes with its task.</p>
